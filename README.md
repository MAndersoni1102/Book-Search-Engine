A simple Book Search Engine built with Apollo Server and GraphQL. This backend service allows users to search for books based on various criteria like title, author, and genre.

🚀 Features
GraphQL API: Use GraphQL to search for books, authors, and genres.
Efficient Queries: Fetch only the data you need using GraphQL's powerful querying capabilities.
Scalable: Easily extend the API with additional queries and mutations as needed.
🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
Yarn (or npm if you prefer)
Steps
Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-search-engine.git

This will start the Apollo Server, and it should be accessible at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

📖 Usage
GraphQL Playground
Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000/graphql. This allows you to interact with the API and test out different queries.

Example Queries
1. Search for books by title:
graphql
Copy code
query {
  searchBooks(title: "The Great Gatsby") {
    title
    author
    genre
    publishedYear
  }
}
2. Get all books by an author:
graphql
Copy code
query {
  booksByAuthor(author: "J.K. Rowling") {
    title
    genre
    publishedYear
  }
}
3. Fetch details of a specific book:
graphql
Copy code
query {
  book(id: "12345") {
    title
    author
    summary
    genre
    publishedYear
  }
}
🧑‍💻 Development
